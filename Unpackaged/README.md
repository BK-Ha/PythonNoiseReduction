# Pyinstaller Files
For those of you who wish to build this program on your own, some of the logs and output information from my builds can be found in these folders.  

Inside the version folders, you'll find unpackaged versions of the program.  This is usefull for figuring out what files should be inside the program if it is built without the --onefile argument for Pyinstaller.  

All the x.gfortran-win32.dll files which cause errors from Scipy when building can be found inside the "gfortran DLLs" folder as well.
