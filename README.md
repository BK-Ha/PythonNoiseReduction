# Python Noise Reduction

This repository is the home of a program I am begining development on which is made to actively "remove" background noise.

As of now, this is only a proof of concept and is very unfinished.  The program is in its early stages currently, but I hope to polish it up over time.

### Changes and Future Additions

#### Version 0.1:
-  Initial build. Remains a proof of concept program still.
-   Compiled files can be found under the Unpackaged folder
-   One Click executibles are located under the folder "OneClick EXE's".  These exe files are click and go. 
-   SPEC files from pyinstaller for personal builds are located in the "SPEC Files for Building" folder.

#### Things to Come!
- Add in option to save files generated in a different location
- Add in ability to create a single sound file as opposed to two files you need to play individually.
- Add in function for the user to pick if the program demonstrates how it works, or if they want to do a live reduction.
- Add in a possible feature where using a microphone we can reduce real world background noise
