# Version 0.1 Source

So far we have created 5 files which all come together to make this program possible.  Each one has its own use and descriptions of each file can be found at the top of each .py file.  If anyone wants to modify this code or make suggestions as to how this can be created in a better way, feel free to make a pull request.
